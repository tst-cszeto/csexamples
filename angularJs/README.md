==========

Core services examples written in angularJS.

##Pre-requisites:
+ yeoman - http://yeoman.io/

##Installation:
+ Initialize all the dependencies: `npm install`
+ Install missing dependency: `bower install jquery`.
  Dunno why this isn't hooked up nor am I sure what
  it's being used for...
+ Launch web server and other common processes: `grunt server`

##Testing:
+ Fire up grunt-karma jasmine unit testing: `grunt test`
+ Fire up grunt-karma ng-scenario e2e testing: `grunt test-e2e`
  (Be sure that you actually have the server up running beforehand via `grunt server`)

Comments are welcome.
