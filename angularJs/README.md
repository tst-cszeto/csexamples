Core services examples written in angularJS.

##Installation:
+ Download the source from github: `git clone git@github.com:tst-cszeto/csexamples.git`
+ Initialize all the dependencies: `npm install`
+ Install missing dependency: `bower install jquery`.  Dunno why this isn't hooked up nor am I sure what it's being used for...

And you should be good to go.  Comments are welcome.
